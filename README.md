# OSeMOSYS-Kenya
This repository houses OSeMOSYS-Kenya models, and scripts developed under the Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) Project.

OSeMOSYS-Kenya models:
- Power sector model
- Full energy system model

Each model requires two files to run:
- model.txt
- data.txt

## model.txt
The model.txt file is directly stored in the repo and is the same file for both the power sector and full energy system models.

## data.txt
The data.txt is managed through the user interface MOMANI.
This repository stores the MOMANI files for the power sector and full energy system models.
Download the osemosys folder, zip it, add it to your local momani/data folder and run deploy.cmd as administrator.
