# OSeMOSYS-Kenya
This repository houses OSeMOSYS-Kenya models and scripts developed under the Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) Project.

## Power system model (PSM)
The power system model describes the power sector at a single power plant level. The model includes storage, in a different implementation from the official OSeMSYS version's one.
The data file has been generated through the MOMANI UI, while the model file contains the specific storage implementation.

## Whole energy system model (WESM)
The whole energy system model includes the power system one, but is expanded to consider all energy sectors. In the current version, no storage technologies are included.
The data file has been generated through the UNDESA UI, and the model file is the same as the one used by the UI.
